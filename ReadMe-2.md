'''LangChain: An Open-Source Framework for Building LLM Applications
> LangChain is an open-source orchestration framework for the development of applications that use Large Language Models (LLMs).
> It's essentially a generic interface for nearly any LLM.
> LangChain streamlines the programming of LLM applications through abstraction.
> LangChain's abstractions represent common steps and concepts necessary to work with language models. These abstractions can be chained together to create applications, minimizing the amount of code required to execute complex Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.

Prompts: Instructions for LLMs
> Prompts are the instructions given to an LLM. LangChain's prompt template class formalizes the composition of prompts without the need to manually hardcode context and queries. A prompt template can contain instructions like "Do not use technical terms in your response" or it could include a set of examples to guide its responses or specify an output format.
> Chains: The Core of LangChain Workflows : Chains are the core of LangChain's workflows. They combine LLMs with other components, creating applications by executing a sequence of functions. For example: An application might need to first retrieve data from a website, then summarize the retrieved text, and finally use that summary to answer user-submitted questions. This is a sequential chain where the output of one function acts as the input to the next. Each function in the chain could use different prompts, different parameters, and even different models.
> External Data Sources: Indexes : LLMs may need to access specific external data sources that are not included in their training dataset. LangChain collectively refers to these data sources as indexes. One of the indexes is the Document Loader, used for importing data sources from sources like file storage services. LangChain also supports vector databases and text splitters.
> LangChain Agents (Optional) : LangChain agents are reasoning engines that can be used to determine which actions to take within an application.

Applications of LangChain

LangChain can be used for various NLP applications, including:

1. Enhanced Chatbots: LangChain can provide proper context for chatbots, integrate them with existing communication channels, and leverage APIs for a more streamlined user experience.
2. Efficient Summarization: Build applications that extract key points from lengthy documents or articles using LLM capabilities.
3. Accurate Question Answering: Develop systems that can search for and deliver clear answers to user queries.
4. Data Augmentation: Generate new training data for your LLMs based on existing information, leading to improved performance.
5. Intelligent Virtual Assistants: Create virtual assistants capable of answering questions, searching for information, and even completing tasks online.'''
